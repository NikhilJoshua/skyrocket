## by Nikhil Joshua

Keywords: `Machine Learning` `Data Science` `Sentiment Analysis` `Text Analytics`

### Abstract
We are trying to predict success/failure of a product using a review dataset. Which basically cantains a review title and a text body. We will be using Sentiment Analysis and Count Vectorization for factor extraction. And then perform ML opertations to identify which feature would be the best to work upon to improve product's sales. We'll also try to integrate LIME to interpret the results.

### Requirements

- Python/Pip
- NLTK Toolkit
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

### Proposed Techniques
- Clustering
- Sentiment Analysis
